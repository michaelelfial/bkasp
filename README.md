# A Classic ASP based playground for BindKraft

This playground is a stripped down version from an old product and as such needs some further clean up in order to be really suitable for public use. This will be done when the time permits, but for the moment I cannot say if this will be in a separate repository or in this one.

The repository contains a number of modules used for internal work, experiments, development workgroung. They are in quite a messy state, the ones that make more sense will/are be/ing published in a polished form in Cleancodefactory (mostly pieces of the BindKraft dev. tooling).

>The repository comes without BindKraft. To use it you need to clone Cleancodefactory/BindKraft into webroot/modules/BindKraft. 

>Note that this technology is not new despite the fact that you can run it on virtually any Windows OS running on Intel x86. Instructions for installation will be added in/with the more cleaned version (a couple of minor bugs have to be fixed also to avoid frustrations). If anybody is interested before that - please contact me (it is easier than any of the modern overblown platforms).
