          <h3>newObjects SQLite 3 Database Manager<br>
          version 1.0</h3>
          <p>This application is distributed as part of the Active Local Pages
          (ALP) product (1.2.1 and later). It is included in all developer oriented ALP packages,
          but is not included in the end-user oriented downloads. A separate
          package containing only the database manager and ALP engine to run it
          is available for those who need the manager without the rest of the
          ALP development tools.</p>
          <p>The newObjects SQLite 3 Database Manager is free. You can modify its source code in any way you want.
            Support for this program may be available as part of a license agreement for commercial product that includes the SQLite3 DB Manger.
            Updates are provided only for the unmodified version if you are using modified version please refer to its vendor for updates and support.
          </p>
          <p>This database manager works with SQLite3 UTF-8 databases only.
          However, an SQLite2 import is available (see Import/Export menu).</p>
