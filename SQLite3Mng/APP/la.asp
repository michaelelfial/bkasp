<h2>Usage rights, granted by the License:</h2>
<p>The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed for every single machine that it is
installed on. The license could be separate (for a single machine) or usage pack
for a few machines, as marked on the cover of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, or the
purchase order. Usage pack (or also often called license pack) is equal to the

personal workstation through the local area network. The usage License may not
be shared amongst the personal workstations, on which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is
used. The USER must obtain a legal usage license for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT for
each single machine it is used on, no matter if a copy of the PRODUCT is
installed on each personal workstation or a network accessible device.</p>
<p>If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT pack includes more than one usage license, the USER
is allowed to make as many copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or its parts, as many
licenses he owns.</p>
<p>The USER is permitted to build or use any software products based on the

<p>The USER is not permitted to redistribute the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and it
components in any form. Redistribution permission may be obtained with
additional license described below.</p>

license which permits redistribution of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and its components
as and only as integral part of the software products developed or otherwise
sold or distributed by the USER.</p>
<p>The DEVELOPER license permits the USER to build and sale/distribute own
software products based on the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and redistribute them in any

product that does not depend on the features provided by the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.</p>
<p>The clients obtaining a software product from the USER who has a DEVELOPER
license are permitted to use its product together with the Active Local Pages
SOFTWARE PRODUCT, assuming the redistributables of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT are
integral part of the USER's product. The USER has right to freely define the
legal conditions for its product, but this cannot include any right or
obligation concerning the SOFTWARE PRODUCT except the right to use it as an
integral part of the product supplied. If the client of the USER's product needs

required. Upgrade</p>

license form owned by the USER is no longer supported by the new version of the
SOFTWARE PRODUCT newObjects replaces the upgraded license by its new version or
number of licenses that will give the USER the same effective rights.</p>

&quot;personal&quot; license. It allowed usage on up to 10 machines. This
license is replaced by 10 individual machine licenses. Other rights and duties:</i></p>

the particular copy may not sell or transfer the usage license of the SOFTWARE
PRODUCT for any kind of payment. An NFR copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may only be
used for purposes of demonstration the PRODUCT's features. The USER of a NFR
version of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may not make or distribute additional copies.</p>
<p>If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is marked as a demonstration version for the final
user (COMMERCIAL DEMO also named in the documentation as SHAREWARE VERSION) the
USER may use it for personal purposes and testing only for up to 90 days. After
this period (often called trial period) the USER must obtain a license for the
SOFTWARE PRODUCT. Without a license the USER is permitted to build and
distribute software that uses the SOFTWARE PRODUCT as long as the distributed
software is distributed freely - not sold. The USER may not include SOFTWARE
PRODUCT in its freeware software but is allowed to include links to the public
archives containing the DEMO/SHAREWARE version of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.</p>

strict permission from newObjects.</p>

be used separately or together outside the bounds defined herein. This excludes
the developer examples included with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.</p>

authorized by newObjects persons or organizations unless it is not an integral
part of another product as described above for the DEVELOPER license.</p>

terms of the particular agreement). Any documentation or software source given
by means of support for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT are treated as parts of it, and the
upper rules are also valid for them. newObjects keep the right of utilizing the
USERs' notes and experience.</p>
<p>The USER may transfer his usage license for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT to another
person or organization, only in case, that he gives to the new user all the
components of the PRODUCT, as well as all the additional materials: information
carriers, this license agreement, printed materials, documentation in electronic
form (computer files, etc.), service packs given as support for the PRODUCT,
etc. The USER must therefore delete all copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. The both
old USER and new one must contact newObjects and new identification key must be
generated for the new USER.</p>
<p>The DEVELOPER license may not be transferred to another person or
organization.</p>
<p>All rights of images, audio and video materials, texts, photographs and other
materials applied to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT are exclusive property of newObjects

the current agreement, if there are no special terms (as exceptions may be
treated for example clip art images, banners, examples etc.).</p>

than the number of licenses he posesses, the USER may not install, copy or use

be distributed on both CD of floppy disk.</p>

on a carrier paid by the USER or delivers a copy in another way, suitable for
the USER.</p>
<p>If the product is obtained from an authorized reseller/partner of newObjects,
the reseller/partner provides the support to the USER. Reseller/partner is
responsible to contact newObjects when required. If the reseller/partner cancels
its agreement with newObjects or otherwise becomes unable to provide support for
the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, the USER is redirected to another reseller/partner or
receives the support directly from newObjects.</p>

from accident, abuse, or misapplication. newObjects is not responsible for any
damages or losses, caused by illegal or incompetent use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

application for which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT was not suited by all means, as well
as any kind of use, not described in the documentation, applied to the SOFTWARE
PRODUCT.</p>

environment. This allows the software products that use its features to consume
services provided by other products and components. newObjects does not provide
